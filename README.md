## üöÄ&nbsp; Setting Up the Development Environment

You can set up a development environment to work on this repository either in the cloud or locally.

### Remote Containerized Development Environment

#### GitHub Codespaces

Create a new development environment via [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/ThomasVitale/supply-chain-security-java-training). Choose a _Region_ close to where you live and select at least a 4-core machine (8-core would be better). GitHub will automatically open the development environment in a Visual Studio Code instance in your web browser.

### Local Containerized Development Environment

#### DevPod

Pre-requisites:

* [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [DevPod](https://devpod.sh)

Open DevPod and create a new Workspace. Choose the _Docker_ provider to configure the Workspace on your local container runtime (it supports both Docker and Podman) and enter the URL to this repository (`github.com/ThomasVitale/supply-chain-security-java-training`). Finally, choose in which IDE you'd like to open the Workspace. By default, the Workspace is opened in a Visual Studio Code instance in your web browser. If you have an IDE installed on your machine (e.g. Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA), you can decide to use one of them instead.

#### Visual Studio Code

Pre-requisites:

* [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed.

Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ThomasVitale/supply-chain-security-java-training.git`) and open it in your local Visual Studio Code. You will be prompted to `Reopen in Container` the project. If you accept, you will get a local containerized development environment and available through your local Visual Studio Code.

#### IntelliJ IDEA

Pre-requisites:

* [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Open IntelliJ IDEA. From the Welcome screen, choose `Remote Development > Dev Containers > New Dev Container` and enter the URL to this repository (`github.com/ThomasVitale/supply-chain-security-java-training`).

### Local Development Environment

Pre-requisites:

* [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* Java 22 (install via [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/jdks))
* Your favourite Java IDE

Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ThomasVitale/supply-chain-security-java-training.git`) and open it in your favourite Java IDE.
